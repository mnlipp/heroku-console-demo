This is a small demonstration of a portal built with the
[JGrapes component frameworks](http://mnlipp.github.io/jgrapes/).

Portlets are rendered in preview mode on the overview tab. Most
portlets also support rendering in view mode. Using the latter
mode, they are rendered in a tab of their own, i.e. they have
the full page available to display their information. What you
currently see is an instance of the markdown portlet rendered
in view mode.

You can use the icon on the top right corner of the portal
to add more portlets to the overview tab.

Technical details about the portal can be found in the
[JavaDoc](http://mnlipp.github.io/jgrapes/javadoc-portal/index.html).
